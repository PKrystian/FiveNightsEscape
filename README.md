# Description:

TODO: Add here description of the whole project.

# Repository contribution:

## Branch Usage:

As pushing to the master branch is restricted, create feature-specific branches for each task or contribution.
Branch names should reflect the task or feature being implemented for easy tracking and referencing during pull requests.

## Pull Request Workflow:

Every pull request requires at least one approval from a team member.
Provide a clear and concise description in your pull request outlining the changes made, their purpose, and any relevant details, and if you're working on something that changes views/layout etc. add screenshot of the changes.

## Coding Style:

All code contributions must align with the Kotlin style guide ([We use Kotlin style guide](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide)).
Adherence to consistent formatting, naming conventions, and best practices outlined in the style guide is crucial.

## Other:

Utilize descriptive commit messages to ensure clarity and ease of understanding for the team members reviewing the changes.
Where applicable, leverage Git's features such as rebase or squash commits to maintain a clean and coherent commit history.
